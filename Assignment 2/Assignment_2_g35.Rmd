# Setting a Seed

In order to ensure that the results in this report are reproducible, seed (123) was used when generating random numbers.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
```
# Task 1

## a)

In order to achieve a 95% confidence interval, we will use a Z-value of $Z = 1.96$, and in order to achieve a margin of error of 2%, we will use a value of $E = 0.02$. Due to the fact that we are working with a proportion, our calculation for the number (n) of surveyed flights should look as follows:

$n = (Z\frac{\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{E})^2$

Because we do not have a value for p, we can assume that p is equal to 0.5 - the value at which $p(1-p)$ will have it's highest value. Therefore, after accounting for all values, we get:

$n = (1.96\frac{\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)}}{0.02})^2 = (1.96\frac{\sqrt{0.25}}{0.02})^2 = 2401$

Therefore, we need 2401 samples in order to get the desired margin of error over the desired confidence interval

## b) 

As the desired confidence interval and Z score remain the same as in part a), we can keep the previously used values of $E = 0.02$ and $Z = 1.96$. Additionally, the formula for calculating n stays the same:

$n = (Z\frac{\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{E})^2$

However, we are given a value for p in this part: 0.9. For this value of p, the calculation for n looks as follows:

$n = (1.96\frac{\sqrt{0.9(1-0.9)}}{0.02})^2 = (1.96\frac{\sqrt{0.09}}{0.02})^2 = 864.36$

Therefore, we need 865 samples in order to get the desired margin of error over the desired confidence interval
